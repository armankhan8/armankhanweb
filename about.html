            I am currently a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology (B.Tech) in CSE With (DS) at
            Lloyd Institute Engineering and technology.
            My academic focus includes honing my skills in various areas of computer science, with a particular emphasis
            on programming language.
            I am passionate about staying on the cutting edge of technology and applying my knowledge to real-world
            problems.
            I've chosen data science because it's the perfect blend of my analytical mindset and my desire to explore
            the world of information, allowing me to solve real-world problems using data-driven insights.
